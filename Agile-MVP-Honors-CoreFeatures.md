## Data Management

> Specify how user data will be collected, stored, and managed.     	

Only necessary user data will be stored, email addresses, UserIDs, Usernames, User Recipies. All user data will be contained within the Users table. Only RecipeIDs will be held in the Users table which will then reference the actual recipe from the Recipies table.

## Feedback and Iteration

> Describe how user feedback will be collected and analyzed.

Feedback will be collected through monthly user prompts which will ask for user's opinions on the app and how their overall expierence is going.

## Future Features

> Provide a glimpse into potential features for future releases.

One potential feature we wish to add in future releases is the "My Touch" feature. My Touch will allow users to reference other user's recipies to add their own personal touch to it. Credit will always be given to the original poster.
