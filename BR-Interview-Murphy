I interviewed my roommate Tyler Murphy.

1. What challenges do you currently face when using similar applications?

One of the biggest challenges I face is navigation and usability. Sometimes the layout is confusing, making it hard to find recipes or features like saving favorites or searching for specific ingredients. Additionally, slow loading times can be frustrating, especially when Iâ€™m trying to quickly find a recipe. I also often encounter limited filtering options, making it difficult to narrow down recipes based on dietary restrictions or cuisine types. Finally, the lack of social interaction features can make it feel isolating; I want to connect with others who share my cooking interests.

2. Can you describe a recent experience where an application did not meet your expectations?

Recently, I used a recipe app that promised a variety of user-generated recipes. I expected to find diverse options and detailed instructions. However, many recipes had incomplete instructions or lacked essential cooking times and ingredient measurements, which led to confusion. Additionally, the app crashed multiple times while I was trying to save favorites, which was incredibly frustrating. I also found that the community features were not very engaging, with minimal comments and interactions, making it feel less like a social experience.

3. What features would you consider essential for improving your experience with such applications?

To enhance my experience, I would consider the following features essential:

    1. Easy Navigation: A clean, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to find recipes and features.

    2. Better Search and Filtering Options: Ability to search by dietary needs, prep time, ingredients, or popularity.

    3. User Reviews and Ratings: Clear feedback from other users on recipes to help me decide what to try.
