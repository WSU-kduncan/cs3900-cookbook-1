Key Entities

Users:

The heart of the application. Users can create profiles, share their culinary journeys, and, perhaps, don a chef's hat in the virtual world. Each user has attributes like username, password, profile picture, bio, and favorite cuisines. Think of them as culinary explorers, each with a unique palate.

Recipes:

The pièce de résistance! Each recipe is a carefully crafted masterpiece, with attributes such as title, ingredients, cooking instructions, preparation time, and cuisine type. Users can post their culinary creations, presenting them like a Michelin-starred dish on a polished plate—complete with a tantalizing image.

Likes:

A digital thumbs-up! This entity captures the affection users have for recipes. Each like connects a user to a specific recipe, showcasing which culinary delights have captured their hearts (or stomachs).

Favorites:

For those recipes that make users swoon, the favorites entity allows users to bookmark their cherished dishes. It’s like a culinary hall of fame, where users can revisit their top picks at any time.

Comments:

The conversational spice of the application. Users can leave comments on recipes, sharing tips, praises, or delightful puns. Each comment is associated with both a user and a recipe, fostering an engaging dialogue akin to a lively kitchen chatter.

Relationships Between Entities

Users and Recipes: A user can create multiple recipes, but each recipe is authored by a single user. This one-to-many relationship allows the community to witness the evolution of a user's culinary skills over time.

Users and Likes: A user can like multiple recipes, and a recipe can be liked by many users. This many-to-many relationship creates a web of culinary popularity, where recipes can soar to fame through the adoration of users.

Users and Favorites: Similar to likes, a user can favorite multiple recipes, and recipes can be favored by multiple users. This relationship ensures that the love for recipes transcends mere likes, solidifying their place in a user’s heart (and virtual kitchen).

Users and Comments: Each comment is crafted by a user on a specific recipe, establishing a one-to-many relationship. This setup allows for a dynamic exchange of ideas and tips, transforming the comment section into a buzzing hive of culinary creativity.

Recipes and Comments: Each recipe can have numerous comments, enhancing the community experience and allowing for rich discussions about the cooking process, ingredients, or just the joy of eating.
