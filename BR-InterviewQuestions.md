# Interview Questions

Remember each team member needs to commit 3 questions & an individual interview.

Questions:

1. What challenges do you currently face when using similar applications?
2. Can you describe a recent experience where an application did not meet your expectations?
3. What features would you consider essential for improving your experience with such applications?



1. How often do you try new recipes and what influences you to try them?
2. How do you currently share recipes with your friends or family? Would the social media integration be useful for you?
3. What do you think about seeing recipes with ratings based on how many people successfully made them?
