- Individual that was interviewed: My mom :))
- How often do you try new recipes and what influences you to try them?
	- I don't really try new recipes because I'm not confident in the kitchen. I like to make dishes that I've already made a bajillion times before but if I were to try a new recipe, it might be if someone is there with me and we're learning together. Or, I'm just craving a specific dish and it's too far away for me to get it (laughs). 
- How do you currently share recipes with your friends or family? Would the social media integration be useful for you?
	- It's either on TikTok or on Instagram Reels because I see the short videos and send it to my daughter. It would be good to have social media integration since she doesn't respond to me through text.
- What do you think about seeing recipes with ratings based on how many people successfully made them?
	- The ratings would be nice because at least other people have triedit and the creator is not full of (poop). Maybe, they can also comment what they would change about it based on dietary restrictions or a faster way to do it. It's all about the confidence and seeing if I can do it too.
